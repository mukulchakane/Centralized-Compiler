# centralized-compiler
We are providing a centralized compiling scheme, where centralized storage for all the compilers are stored. There is no need to maintain separate compilers or SDKâ€™s at client side. User authentication and personalized task distribution. i.e. the administrator will be able to assign user-id, password & personalized tasks to all the clients. Both the error stream and output stream of the compiler will be captured and the output will be sent to client.

A database of all the codes written by the clients will be maintained. A client may retrieve the stored-code at any later instance. The administrator will have full authority to compile & execute the codes stored by clients for evaluation. All the Statistical details of compilation time, execution time, etc. will be maintained at the server side. Direct comparison of outputs of all the clients can be done at the server side. A client may be assigned a different task every time he/she logs in depending on the will of the administrator.
